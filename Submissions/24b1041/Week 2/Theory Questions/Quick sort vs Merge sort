We should choose Quick sort over Merge sort when our priorities are speed(unlike worst case)
and memory efficiency.
1.Quick sort has average case time complexity of O(n log n), so better than merge sort.
2.Space complexity of Quick sort of stack space of recursion is O(log n), whereas for merge sort it is O(n).(we were talking about stack space of recursion)
3.Quick sort's swaps are better than auxiliary arrays of merge sort's.

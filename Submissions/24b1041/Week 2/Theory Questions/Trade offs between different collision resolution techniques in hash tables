Collision Resolution Techniques are used in hash tables for resolving collision 
conflicts which occur when multiple keys hash to the same slot.
There are two main approaches:
1.Open Addressing(closed hashing)
2.Separate Chaining(Open hashing) 

1.Open Addressing:
  1.The memory overhead is low because here no pointer are used.
  2.The cache performance is better because of sequential memory access.
  3.This performs poorly when load factor becomes high.
  4.If we want to delete then it becomes tricky it requires tombstones and rehashing.
  5.Implementation is easy.

2.Separate Chaining:
  1.The memorh overhead is high because we store linked list nodes.
  2.The cache performance is worse because of scattered memory.
  3.It handles high load factor better.
  4.Deletions are also simple just remove from the list.
  5.Implementation is more complex.

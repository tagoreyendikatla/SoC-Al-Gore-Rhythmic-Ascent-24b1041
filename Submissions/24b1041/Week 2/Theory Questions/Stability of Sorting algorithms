A stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative order of equal elements.
A sorting algorithm will be stable when we take care sorting by multiple 
criteria, preserving meaningful order.

1.Stability is achieved by avoiding unnecessary swaps, by maintaining order 
during sorting, by using auxiliary structures.

Bubble sort, Insertion sort, merge sort, timsort, counting sort are examples
of stable algorithms. And Heap sort, Quick sort, selection sort, Shell sort are
examples of unstable algorithms.
